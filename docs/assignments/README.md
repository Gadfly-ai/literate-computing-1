## writing support

please use discord if you need support in coming up with a writing goal.
use your teacher, TA, and classmates to get through these challenges supported.

### bounding your ideas

a writer always knows there is more they want to write, with time, you'll get there. for now, try to write about one small idea at a time, if you start adding ideas as if they are needed.
